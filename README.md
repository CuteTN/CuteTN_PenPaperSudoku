# PenPaperSudoku
A Sudoku game which you can have Pen &amp; Paper experience (seriously :) )

~~This project was made for fun and is mainly a joke!~~

## 1. Gameplay
  - Create a new game by pressing: **`Ctrl + N`**. **Remember to connect to the Internet** :) you can also choose your new game's difficulty.
  - At the top-left corner, click on the drawing tool you want to use. Maker would be your main tool to draw.
  - Draw your numbers by dragging the mouse. You **cannot** use your number keyboard. You know, it's Pen & paper :) the app will recognise your number! ~~(but this doesn't work so perfectly...)~~
  
  Note: in the first run, please copy the folder **NumberData** to the same directroy as the execution file.
  
## 2. Technique
### a. Number recognition:
- Use simple AI model to decide which digit best matches with the user drawing.
